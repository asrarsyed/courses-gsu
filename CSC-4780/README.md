<h1 align="center">CSC 4780 - Fundamentals of Data Science</h1>

This course provides an overview of data science concepts, methods, and tools used to extract insights from data. Topics include data processing and representation, exploratory data analysis and visualization, statistical foundations, machine learning algorithms, feature engineering, model evaluation, and ensemble methods. We experience using Python-based data science libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to analyze real-world datasets. Emphasizing breadth across key techniques, the course enables comparison of algorithms, understanding their strengths and limitations, and appropriate application to practical problems.
