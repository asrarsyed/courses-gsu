<h1 align="center">CSC 4320 - Operating Systems</h1>

This course explores fundamental concepts and design principles of modern operating systems. Topics include process and thread management, CPU scheduling algorithms, synchronization and concurrency control, deadlock prevention and recovery, memory management techniques, virtual memory systems, and virtualization. The course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical implementation through programming and analytical assignments that reinforce core operating system mechanisms. By examining classical and modern operating systems, the course develops understanding of how operating systems manage hardware resources and provide essential services to applications, building strong analytical skills for reasoning about system-level behavior.
