(2) Explain the time complexity of your implementation to the lab instructor.

    Overall Time Complexity: O(n+k) -> where n (the size of the array) and k is (the range of values) between the minimum and maximum values.
    The algorithm takes O(n) to find the minimum and maximum values, O(n) to populate the count array and O(k) to reconstruct the sorted array.
    This makes it efficient when k (the range of values) is not significantly larger than n (the size of the array).


(3) Explain the space complexity of your implementation to the lab instructor.

    Overall Space Complexity: O(n+k) -> The algorithm uses linear space for the array and additional space proportional to the range of values.
    The algorithm takes O(n) space for the sorted output array, and O(k) space to account for the count array size.
    This makes it space-efficient only when k (the range of values) is close to n (the size of the array).


(4) Do you recommend using counting sort algorithm for the following arrays? Why?
    Array 1: [527, 8763, 12, 45, 9076, 298, 7603, 432, 1, 30456]
    Array 2: [10, 5, 7, 12, 8, 5, 14, 15, 6, 13]
    Array 3: [2300, 2298, 2299, 2302, 2307, 2305, 2304, 2302, 2306, 2303]

    Array 1: Not Recommended 
        The range of values is large (30456 - 1 = 30455), while the number of elements is small (n = 10).
        This makes space usage O(k) inefficient.
    Array 2: Recommended 
        The range of values is small (15 - 5 = 10), and it has a comparable number of elements (n = 10).
        The counting sort algorithm makes sense here, as it is efficient O(n+k).
    Array 3: Recommended
        The range of values is small (2307 - 2298 = 10), and it has a comparable number of elements (n = 10).
        The counting sort algorithm also makes sense here, as k is minimal compared to n.
