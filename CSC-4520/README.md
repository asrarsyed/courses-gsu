<h1 align="center">CSC 4520 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h1>

This course focuses on designing and analyzing efficient algorithms for solving computational problems. It reviews core data structures before covering algorithmic techniques such as divide-and-conquer, greedy strategies, dynamic programming, and randomized algorithms. Topics include sorting, searching, graph algorithms, shortest paths, network flow, computational complexity, and NP-completeness. Emphasis is placed on algorithm correctness, analyzing time and space efficiency, and understanding trade-offs between different algorithmic approaches.
