<h1 align="center">CSC 3220 - System-Level Programming</h1>

This course examines system-level programming using the C language within a UNIX environment. It covers essential UNIX commands, shell scripting, file systems, process creation, interprocess communication, and low-level file handling. The focus is on interacting directly with operating system services through system calls, managing processes, and debugging programs that operate close to the hardware. Hands-on labs and programming assignments reinforce concepts related to efficiency, correctness, and system interaction in real-world operating systems.
