  Purpose:
    To find all of the factors of a integer that is taken from user.
  Pre-conditions (input): 
    The inputs could be a positive or negative integer.
  Post-conditions (output): 
    A list containing all the possible factors of the integer.

# main function - Design
 
  # Defining the main function

  # Importing the helper module

  # Displaying an introductory message

  # Collecting the integer input variables

  # Defining the ‘foundFactors’ functions

  # Checking if positive integer and printing the factor list

  # Checking if positive or negative

  # Call the main function

  # End of Program

    Specifications for the implementation

    1) This program uses input; you will have to prompt the user for the inputs. The
    inputs can be assumed to be integers.

    2) You must download helper.py from icollege (to the folder that has your solution)
    and import helper.py (do not copy the code from the helper.py file, you must only
    import)

    3) You must use at least two functions and use helper.findingFactors() from
    helper.py to find if the number is prime.

    4) Find a prime number should be its own function and should be called
    ‘foundFactors’ that prints the desired output message

    5) You should have a main function and you should call foundFactors to find out if
    the number is prime or not.

    6) Make sure you format the lines of the output as described. The line breaks and the
    punctuation should be as shown. The output messages should be exactly as given.

    7) Make sure to show display the output for all if it's Prime or Not Prime to inform
    the user of what was entered. I will update the HW-Doc to align with these
    comments
