<h1 align="center">CSC 4330 - Programming Language Concepts</h1>

This class explores the fundamental ideas behind programming language design and implementation. Topics include functional programming, logic programming, regular languages and regular expressions, grammars and parsing techniques, and concurrency models. A comparative approach highlights how different paradigms influence expressiveness, correctness, and problem-solving strategies, with hands-on work in languages such as Haskell and Prolog. The course investigates how language features influence expressiveness, correctness, and computational models, developing deeper understanding of programming language design and the ability to apply different paradigms to solve computational problems.
