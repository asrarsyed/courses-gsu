Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
